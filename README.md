# Accenture Forage Data Analysis Program

## Task One: Project Understanding
### Objective:
Understanding the client's business problem and the project requirements to align the data analysis tasks.

Mae Mulligan, one of Accenture's Managing Directors, leads the project for Social Buzz. After reviewing the client brief, she assembled a team of experts to address the client's challenges. The team participated in a project kick-off call to initiate the task.

Social Buzz, a rapidly growing client, faces a challenge with their increasing scale and lack of internal resources to manage it effectively. Accenture is tasked with auditing their big data practices, providing recommendations for an IPO, and analyzing their popular content.

As a data analyst, the key focus was on analyzing sample data sets and visualizing the popularity of different content categories, ultimately answering the client’s business question: “Which are the top 5 categories with the largest popularity?”

## Task Two: Data Cleaning & Modeling
### Objective:
Selecting, cleaning, and preparing the data for analysis to address the client’s business question.

To answer the business question, the first step was identifying the datasets needed for the analysis. After reviewing the data, the required datasets included:
- Reaction Score (quantifying popularity)
- Content ID
- Reaction Types
- Content Type
- Category

The data was cleaned by:
- Removing rows with missing values
- Adjusting the data type of certain columns
- Removing irrelevant columns

This resulted in a cleaned dataset that was ready for further modeling. The next step was merging relevant data tables to create a final dataset, which provided insights into the top 5 content categories.

## Task Three: Data Visualization & Storytelling
### Objective:
Presenting the findings through effective data visualization and storytelling.

To convey the insights from the analysis, a PowerPoint presentation was created following the given template. This presentation focused on showcasing the most popular content categories and supported the narrative with visualizations that highlighted key data trends.

## Task Four: Present to the Client
### Objective:
Deliver the insights to the client by presenting the analysis and data visualizations.

A final step was to present the PowerPoint presentation to the client, delivering clear and actionable insights based on the data analysis, helping Social Buzz better understand their content’s popularity and performance.
